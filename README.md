# Hello I'm Abdullah

I'm a computer science student passionate about building things on the internet. 

My recent projects that I'm proud of 
- MiniGen (a minimalist framework for building agentic systems with native openai compatibility api)
- Relearn (a generative ai platform for learning through visuals and interactive simulation)
- NeoCode (an ai coding agent for building website in realtime)

I love experimenting and integrating foundation models, on-device LLMs, and software.
